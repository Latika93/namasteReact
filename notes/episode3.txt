#script
for large productions

#jsx is not HTML inside js
it is javascript syntax, html like you can say
JSX is not react.
But a easier syntax to write js. It is also object.

js engine/browser understands ecmascript [es6] but not html

//jsx (Transpiled before it reaches the JS) -Parcel - Babel
//JSX => React.createElement => ReactElement-JS Object => HTML(render)
const jsx = <h1>Through JSX elements</h1>;
Babel convert jsx to react code 

a functional component is a function that returns jsx piece of code

//component composition
component inside a functional component

i would have to give unique key to component in case of using map

config driven UI 

we have to give unique key to component in case of using map, but why?
if we don't do this, react would have to rerender every new element adds up.
it is not good for opimization
we may use index also, but not recommended
