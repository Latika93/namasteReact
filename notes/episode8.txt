# ClassbasedComponent

=> Why do we need super(props)?
allows accessing this.props in a Constructor function. what the super() function does is, calls the constructor of the parent class. 

1. for class.. you have to fetch it form constructors.

what is basically, rendering a function?
Mounting/Loading that functin on webpage. Calling that function.

But
when we loading a ClassbasedComponent, then it means, we are creating an instance of this class.

2. To craete state
this.state = {
    //initialize here.
}
