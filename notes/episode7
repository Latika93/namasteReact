Finding the Path

=> IN this episode, we made all restraunt cards clickable and went to restraunt specific content all over the page

=> if no dependency array (every time my component render, useEffect called.)

=> if dependency array[] => useEffect called once

=> state variables are meant to be intialized always in fucntional component at higher level [not in if condition, not in loop, never nested]

=> createBrowserRouter from react-router-dom 
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
    {
        path: '/',
        element: <AppLayout />
    },
    {
        path: '/about',
        element: <About />
    }
]);


root.render(<RouterProvider router={appRouter} />);

=> Children Routes
using <Outlet />

=> we should never use <a></a> because it reload the whole page, means less optimized

=> comparison
<Link to="" />
<a href="" />

Funfact: In BTS, Link itself use anchor tag

THAT IS WHY, MY DEAR FRIENDS, REACT IS USED TO CREATE SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION

=> Types of Routing:
Server-Side Routing = [make call to network [see changes in network tab], fetch data from there]

Client-side Routing = [No Network calls, as we see in above routing]

=> useParams is hook given by react-router-dom for dynamic routing
