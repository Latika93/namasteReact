#script
for large productions

#jsx is not HTML inside js
it is javascript syntax, html like you can say
JSX is not react.
But a easier syntax to write js. It is also object.

js engine/browser understands ecmascript [es6] but not html

//jsx (Transpiled before it reaches the JS) -Parcel - Babel
//JSX => React.createElement => ReactElement-JS Object => HTML(render)
const jsx = <h1>Through JSX elements</h1>;
Babel convert jsx to react code 

a functional component is a function that returns jsx piece of code

//component composition
component inside a functional component
