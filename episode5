React is fast because of efficient DOM-manipulation

# React Hook
It is simple javascript functions (utility function) written by facebook engineers

whenver we change state, react rerender the component

React sync my datalayer with UI layer

Reconciliation algorithm[React-Fiber]
- Virtual DOM is javascript representation of Actual DOM -- it is nothing but normal JS object
- once there is a change in state, react will find out a difference in Virtual DOM, and rerender the component [Update the Virtual DOM]
- React fiber is ongoing re-implementation of React's core algorithm.
